    """The parent as a macro, its blocks, and the flat top level that checks the carve.

    The plan in git is all the parent and the blocks share: the blocks'
    outlines and places and every block pin (plan_floorplan.py's
    <block>_pins.tcl, clock pins included). The blocks build from their
    pin files; the parent, <name>_<stage>, builds from the same files and
    nothing of a block's, so all of them build side by side to global
    route, each its own fast signal, and only the top level,
    <name>_pm_<stage>, waits for all of them.

    The parent is the design's own RTL with the blocks blackboxes,
    cut out in synthesis (evert.tcl: each block pin a port
    u_<block>__<pin>, the instance gone), on the plan's die with a hole
    per block (parent_holes.tcl). <name>_abstract is its LEF with
    exact shapes, <name>_timing_model its timing model.

    The top level is the parent and the blocks, instances only
    (top_netlist.tcl), each placed by the plan and dissolved into the
    cells, nets and route guides of its own global route, its clock tree
    left behind (top_dissolve.tcl): the cells stay fixed where their
    macro put them. top_level.tcl builds it in two passes. The first,
    <name>_pm_firm_top, builds one clock tree over every register and
    routes the stitches and the clock, every cell where its macro put it.
    The second starts again from the floorplan: <name>_pm_top_place
    unfirms the cells on the first pass's crossing paths over the
    report's budget (unfirm.tcl: made movable, their nets' routes
    dropped), places them by global placement with timing and
    routability driving among the fixed rest and repairs them;
    <name>_pm_top builds the clock tree and routes, as the first pass.

    The crossing report: every reg2reg path not contained in one macro
    that needs more than budget_ps, each cell on it by name, timed in
    sets of macros that fit memory. <name>_pm_crossing_plan finds the
    sets (crossing_plan.tcl), <name>_pm_crossing_sets cuts each to its
    crossing cones and writes it with its parasitics as SPEF,
    <name>_pm_crossing_time times each in a process of its own, and
    <name>_pm_crossings merges them: crossing.txt, tables.md and
    histogram.svg. These are the second pass's; the first pass's are
    <name>_pm_firm_crossing_plan, _sets, _time and <name>_pm_firm_crossings,
    under <name>_pm/firm. <name>_pm_crossing_ends writes the end pins of
    the first pass's crossings over the budget from its crossing data
    (crossing_ends.py), the second pass's input, and
    <name>_pm_crossing_verdict compares the two reports
    (crossing_verdict.py). The second pass needs a crossing over the
    budget in the first: with none there is nothing to unfirm, and
    <name>_pm_crossing_ends stops, and every target of the second pass
    with it.

    Run by hand: <name>_pm_unfirm, the second pass's selection on the
    floorplan, its counts and its stops' controls (unfirm_check.tcl), and
    <name>_pm_crossing_floor, how much of each crossing of the second
    pass is wire (crossing_floor.tcl), with its control,
    <name>_pm_crossing_floor_control.

    Args:
      name: the parent macro's flow; the top level is <name>_pm.
      top: the design's top module, the parent macro's module.
      plan: the PLAN dict plan_floorplan.py wrote.
      plan_pins: {block: its plan pins file}.
      place_macros: the plan's place_macros.tcl: the parent's own
        macros and placed netlists where the plan put them.
      blocks: {block: {"abstract": its abstract target, "grt": its
        global route target}}.
      verilog_files: the design's RTL, the blocks' included.
      arguments: the parent macro's arguments.
      sources: the parent macro's sources.
      user_arguments: the parent macro's user arguments; a
        SYNTH_POST_HIERARCHY_SCRIPTS among them runs before evert.ys.
      user_sources: the parent macro's user sources.
      user_stages: the parent macro's user stages.
      stage_arguments: the parent macro's per-stage arguments, over
        arguments (orfs_flow's stage_arguments).
      top_arguments: the top level's arguments, over the defaults.
      top_sources: the top level's sources, over the defaults
        (SDC_FILE at least).
      macros: the parent's own macros.
      clock_port: the design's clock port.
      block_clocks: the blocks' clock pins, by name.
      budget_ps: the longest reg2reg path, ps, that may cross a macro
        boundary.
      max_skew_ps: the top level's clock skew it stops over, ps.
      report_budget_ps: the crossing report's budget, ps; budget_ps by
        default.
      plan_budget: instances a crossing set may hold, the measure of
        its memory.
      top_level_arguments: ORFS variables for top_level.tcl's runs
        (SKIP_PIN_ACCESS).
      top_level_user_arguments: top_level.tcl's own settings
        (TOP_DPL_ARGS, TOP_GRT_ITERATIONS, TOP_PARASITICS).
      crossing_data_min_ps: the crossing timing also writes every crossing
        path needing more than this, under the budget too, with its wire
        delay and both ends' places (crossing_data.<set>.tsv beside the
        report), for the carve's offline model and for the second pass,
        which takes its ends from the first pass's; below the report's
        budget, or the flow is refused.
      whole_check: the checks for a design small enough to time whole:
        the top level timed whole, <name>_pm_crossing_whole, reports the
        paths the sets do (<name>_pm_crossing_test); the launch and
        headroom checks; the second pass's selection and stops
        (<name>_pm_unfirm_test), its verdict against the first
        (<name>_pm_crossing_verdict_test), the constraints both hand on
        (<name>_pm_top_sdc_test) and the crossing floor
        (<name>_pm_crossing_floor_test).
      headroom_sets: the crossing sets <name>_pm_crossing_headroom
        measures, their numbers separated by spaces; empty: every set.
      headroom_skip: the measurements it skips, of: wire vt skew cycles.
      unfirm_user_arguments: top_level.tcl's settings for the second
        pass's place step, <name>_pm_top_place, and <name>_pm_unfirm:
        TOP_UNFIRM_DEEP, the registers deep past the paths' own the
        selection takes (0, the paths only); TOP_UNFIRM_SIDE, the side
        that depth is taken on, both (default), back or fwd;
        TOP_CLOCK_PERIOD, the period, ps, the place step is timed at, the
        SDC's by default. Any other key is refused.
      variant: the parent macro's variant, when another flow of the
        package has the same top module; its targets are then
        <name>_<variant>_<stage>, and <name>_<variant> stands for <name>
        above.
      pdk: the PDK.
      tags: forwarded.
