"""Do a module's per-entry arrays follow one rule per entry? The core of
generate_array's front end, on yosys JSON after proc (proc_json.py).

An array is a register vector whose words yosys keeps as one flop each,
$driver$<array>[<i>], or firtool's scalarised vector of bundles,
<array>_<i>_<field>. Arrays of the same length make up entries: entry i
is word i of every one of them. Entry i's private cone is the logic that
reaches its flops' inputs and no other entry's; logic that reaches
several entries is shared and stays outside.

Each private cone is walked into a structural signature: the entry's own
flops named by array and bit, another entry's by its offset from this
one, a shared or outside bit by its net, relative to the entry where the
net is per entry (bit i, or bit i*w+j of a w-bit field i), and every
constant as K. Entries with one signature have the same structure; their
constants, met in the same order, must then each be the same in every
entry or the entry's index (s*i+o). Such entries follow one rule: one
cell, instanced per entry, its index an input (extract.py).

yosys writes the comparison with index 0 differently (x == 0 as !x or
~|x); those are read as the comparison they are. So are thresholds,
x >= K and x < K, which firtool folds differently for each K (x >= 4 as
|x[6:2], x >= 64 as x[6] alone, x >= 3 as x > 2): on a net where some
entry compares against a threshold that is no x == K, every comparison
of the net reads as one (x != 0 as x >= 1).
