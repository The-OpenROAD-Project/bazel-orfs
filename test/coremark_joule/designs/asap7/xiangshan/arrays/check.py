"""Check an extraction (extract.py) against the module it came from: the
registers are the same, so the check is combinational, every register a
cut point (its Q an input, its D, enable and reset outputs, by the
original register's name in both designs) and a miter of the two proved
by SAT (yosys miter, sat; not the equiv_* passes, which are too slow).

    check.py <yosys> <original.json> <extracted.json> <module> [mutate]
    check.py <yosys> --lemma <entries> <index bits>

With mutate, one gate of the extracted cell is changed first: a negative
control that must come out not equivalent.

Decode-once is proved in two steps, because a miter of the whole design
no longer collapses once the comparisons are rewritten (everything
downstream of them differs in structure): the extraction with the index
kept (extract.py --keep-idx) against the original, by the miter, and the
lemma that decode-once rests on, (1 << x)[i] == (x == i) for every entry
i and every x: replacing a signal by one equal to it changes nothing.
