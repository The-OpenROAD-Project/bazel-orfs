# Fold slang's per-instance copies of each module in XS_FOLD_MODULES back
# onto one module of the bare name, so synthesis maps it once.
#
# Run as SYNTH_CANONICALIZE_TCL, before the canonical checkpoint is
# written: bazel-orfs's partitioned synthesis resolves a kept module to
# one copy in that checkpoint (synth_partition.sh), so the fold must come
# first for every instance to be that partition. The slang frontend
# elaborates one module per instance and names it after the instance
# path (RobEntry$<path>): the Rob's 352 entry cells would be 352 modules
# and 352 ABC runs. The modules listed are the arrays front end's entry
# cells (arrays/extract.py), which take no parameters, so every copy is
# the same module: one copy is renamed to the bare name, every instance
# retyped onto it, and the rest pruned.
