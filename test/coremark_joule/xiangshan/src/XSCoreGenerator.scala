// Elaborate XiangShan for the CoreMark-per-Joule study.
//
// The study hardens XSCore -- the core with its L1I and L1D, which is the
// measurement boundary -- but XSCore is a diplomacy LazyModule whose nodes
// bind upward to L2Top, so it cannot be elaborated on its own without
// hand-writing the tie-off. Elaborating upstream's own XSTop avoids that
// entirely: firtool emits one Verilog module per Chisel module, so XSCore
// arrives as its own module with its own ports, and the synthesis top is a
// choice made in config.mk rather than surgery done here.
//
// Everything outside XSCore is elaborated because the core cannot run
// without it, and hardened by nobody.

/** XiangShan V3 (Kunminghu) as the study measures it.
  *
  * Derived from upstream's DefaultConfig with two changes, both outside the
  * measurement boundary:
  *
  *   - A small last-level cache. XiangShan V3 hardcodes enableCHI, so the
  *     non-CHI path with its plain AXI SoC is dead code and OpenLLC is not
  *     optional: XSTop instantiates it whenever CHI is on, and a config
  *     without OpenLLCParamsOpt fails to elaborate. It shrinks from 32 MB
  *     to 1 MB instead, which is simulation cost avoided and nothing else,
  *     since the study hardens no cache past L1.
  *   - A small L2. CoreMark's working set fits in L1 after the first
  *     iteration, so L2 capacity has no measurable effect on the cycle
  *     count, and a 2 MB L2 is expensive to simulate.
  *
  * The L1s are untouched: 64 KB each for instruction and data, which is
  * also the size ACM CF'25 normalized its cores to, so the two studies
  * measure the same amount of cache.

/** Everything CoreMark cannot use, removed.
  *
  * CoreMark is an integer benchmark running bare metal in machine mode.
  * A floating-point unit, a vector unit, the hypervisor extension and the
  * memory BIST logic all contribute area and leakage to the energy figure
  * and do no work in it, and they are most of what makes this design slow
  * to synthesise. What stays is what produces the score: eight-wide
  * decode, rename and commit, the ROB and load/store queues, the branch
  * predictor, and 64 KB L1 caches.
  *
  * Two things this deliberately does not do, both measured rather than
  * assumed.
  *
  * HasFPU and HasVPU are set, but they do not remove the datapath.
  * backendParams unconditionally carries FpScheduler and VecScheduler
  * with their full execution-unit lists -- elaboration still builds
  * VFEX1, vialu, vfma and vimac -- so the flags gate ISA behaviour rather
  * than hardware. Removing the units means overriding the scheduler
  * parameters inside XSCoreParameters, which the wake-up configs,
  * register files, dispatch widths and ROB uop fields all reference by
  * name. That is a fork of the parameterisation, not a configuration, and
  * it is not attempted here. With SAIF-driven power it also matters less
  * than it looks: an idle vector unit toggles almost nothing, so it costs
  * leakage rather than dynamic energy.
  *
  * Two further knobs do not elaborate at all. HasHExtension = false fails
  * in MMUBundle with "High index 37 is out of range [0, 35]", and
  * EnableSv48 = false makes the ICache's address-field formatter compute
  * a negative field index. Both are left on.
  *
  * What this fragment actually buys is about four percent: 1443 modules
  * and 2.82 M lines become 1379 and 2.71 M. The turnaround problem this
  * study hit is not design size -- it is sixteen parallel yosys processes
  * each parsing the same 154 MB file.
  *
  * This is a deliberate departure from Kunminghu as delivered, and it is
  * the more honest thing to measure -- nobody ships a vector unit to run
  * CoreMark -- but it does mean the result is not directly comparable
  * with XiangShan's own published figures. See
  * coremark-mhz-replication.md.
