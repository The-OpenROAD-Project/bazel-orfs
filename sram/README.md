fakeram vs. mock SRAM
=====================

fakeram is a .lib, .lef and .v file generated by the fakeram tool.

mocked SRAM takes as input the design's behavioral model Verilog file and is used to generate a .lef and .lib file.

Mock SRAM based on fakeram's behavioral .v file
-----------------------------------------------

The .v file generated by fakeram does not build with yosys unmodified. The fakeram/sdq_17x64.sv has been manually pruned until it passed yosys.

    bazel run //sram:top_grt `pwd`/build
    build/make gui_grt

fakeram
-------

There is a problem with this setup: there is no clock visible in the OpenROAD GUI. A problem with the fakeram .lib file?

    bazel run //sram:top_fakeram_grt `pwd`/build
    build/make gui_grt


MegaBoom mock SRAM
------------------

A mock SRAM based on the MegaBoom behavioral Verilog.

    bazel run //sram:top_megaboom_grt `pwd`/build
    build/make gui_grt
